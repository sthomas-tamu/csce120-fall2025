Texas Fight, Texas Fight,
And it’s good-bye to A&M. 
Texas Fight, Texas Fight, 
And we’ll put over one more win. 
Texas Fight, Texas Fight, 
For it’s Texas that we love best. 
Hail, Hail, The gang’s all here, 
And it’s good-bye to all the rest!

Yea Orange! Yea White! 
Yea Longhorns! Fight! Fight! Fight! 
Texas Fight! Texas Fight, 
Yea Texas Fight! Texas Fight! 
Texas Fight, Yea Texas Fight!

The Eyes of Texas are upon you, 
All the livelong day. 
The Eyes of Texas are upon you, 
You cannot get away. 
Texas Fight, Texas Fight, 
For it’s Texas that we love best. 
Hail, Hail, The gang’s all here, 
And it good-bye to all the rest!
